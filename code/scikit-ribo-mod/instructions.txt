Our pipeline requires a modified version of the Scikit-ribo tool to process ribosome profiling data. 

Download Scikit-ribo from https://github.com/hanfang/scikit-ribo

Replace the file "scikit_ribo/plot_ribo_density_dict_noCDT.py" by the modified one provided. Instead of 
preparing visual output, the scikit-ribo output is saved for further processing/analysis. 

Install Scikit-ribo as per instructions and add the local path to the pipeline.py script.
